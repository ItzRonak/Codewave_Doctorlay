Mr. Saugat, 

Based on your provided information, I am concerned about several potential issues. While it's impossible to give a definitive diagnosis without a physical examination, here's my professional assessment: 

**Possible Conditions:**

* **Respiratory Issues:** The cough and weakness could indicate a respiratory infection like bronchitis or pneumonia.  It's important to rule out these possibilities with a chest x-ray and a thorough physical examination.
* **Stress and Fatigue:** Irregular sleep patterns, frequent masturbation, and a sedentary lifestyle (lack of exercise) can lead to chronic fatigue, weakness, and even nausea and dizziness.  
* **Underlying Nutritional Deficiency:**  While your weight seems to be within a healthy range, your lack of exercise and potentially unhealthy dietary habits could contribute to nutritional deficiencies.
* **Ringworm:** The presence of ringworm on your neck is a common fungal infection that can be treated with topical antifungal medications. However, it's essential to ensure the diagnosis is accurate as other skin conditions might mimic ringworm.

**Diagnosis and Treatment:**

1. **Comprehensive Examination:** It's essential to schedule an appointment with your doctor for a complete physical examination. This will include:
    * **Blood work:**  To check for any infections, inflammation, or nutritional deficiencies.
    * **Chest X-ray:** To rule out pneumonia or other lung issues.
    * **Skin Examination:** To confirm the ringworm diagnosis and rule out other skin conditions.

2. **Treating the Ringworm:**  Based on the doctor's confirmation, topical antifungal creams or oral medications will likely be prescribed to treat the ringworm infection.

3. **Addressing Fatigue and Sleep:** 
    * **Establish a Sleep Schedule:**  Work towards a regular sleep schedule, aiming for 7-8 hours of sleep nightly.
    * **Stress Management:**  Explore relaxation techniques such as meditation, yoga, or deep breathing exercises to manage stress. 
    * **Physical Activity:** Start with light exercises like walking or swimming 30 minutes daily to improve your energy levels and overall health.

4. **Nutritional Evaluation:** 
    * **Diet Consultation:**  Speak with a registered dietitian to create a healthy eating plan that addresses your individual needs and helps you maintain a balanced diet.
    * **Hydration:**  Ensure you're drinking plenty of water throughout the day.

**Prevention is Key:**

* **Regular Checkups:**  Schedule annual physical examinations and necessary follow-ups with your doctor.
* **Healthy Lifestyle:**  Adopt a healthy lifestyle with regular exercise, a balanced diet, and good sleep hygiene.
* **Stress Management:** Find healthy ways to manage stress.
* **Early Intervention:**  Don't ignore any concerning symptoms, consult your doctor promptly for early diagnosis and treatment.

**Remember:**  Your health is a priority, and it's important to take proactive steps to maintain it.  Follow your doctor's recommendations and be patient with the treatment process.  It's about creating a healthy lifestyle for long-term well-being.
